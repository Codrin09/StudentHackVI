# Flask app

To run a flask app, all you have to do is:
1. Set it up: `export FLASK_APP=app.py`
2. Run it with Flask: `flask run`

Also if you turn on debugging (`export FLASK_DEBUG=1`) before running, the server will reload itself on code changes.
Also when shit goes down the fan, Flask will even show you a console in the browser to help you debug stuff.
